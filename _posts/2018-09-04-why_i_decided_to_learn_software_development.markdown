​
Since I was a child, I've always been fascinated with taking things apart to see how they work, putting them back together and building new things. Early on I took art classes and learned to draw, sculpt paint etc. At 13  I got my first computer and my creative and technical interests began to merge as I started to use early versions of Photoshop and other design software.  
​
I always passively wondered how all of the programs I was using worked behind the scenes but did not really know how to pursue learning about software development back then. The impression that I got was that coding was only for people with an aptitude for math, which was something I certainly did not possess. So I focused on pursuing a career in art which lead me to studying Graphic Design in college.

Now at 36 I’ve grown tired of working in graphic design mainly because you are often forced to churn out work that you are not really proud of or passionate about simply because it is what is demanded by the client. Luckily since the last time I had looked, the path to learning to code had become less intimidating thanks to the founding of the boot camps. I took advantage of the prep course here and really started to feel the satisfaction I used to get from finishing a drawing whenever I got a test to pass or learned a new technique. 

Now each day when I wake up, I know I will get to face an interesting challenge and learn something new. I look forward to seeing how I can combine my design skills with what I am learning here in order to create projects I am passionate about.
